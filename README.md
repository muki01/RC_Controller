# üõ©Ô∏è RC Controller
This project is an ESP32-based RC controller that allows you to control RC drones via the NRF24 module and also use it for drone simulators on a PC through Bluetooth.

The controller features 10 channels, providing ample flexibility for controlling complex drones or adding custom functionalities.

–¢he controller is not quite ready. I will add more features.

## ‚ú® Features
- 10-Channel Control: Offers 10 independent control channels, making it suitable for advanced drone configurations and additional peripherals.
- NRF24 Communication: Control real RC drones wirelessly using the NRF24L01 module.
- Bluetooth Connectivity: Seamlessly connect the controller to your computer for use with drone simulators, providing a realistic flying experience.
- Customizable: Modify and expand the code to suit your specific needs, whether for different types of drones or simulators.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works with various flight simulation software that supports Bluetooth controllers.

* Upload the code to your Board
* Upload the data folder to SPIFFS.
  - To upload the data folder, you can use PlatformIO or you can upload with tool for Arduino IDE v1.x.x</br>
  [Here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/) is documentation how to upload files to SPIFFS with Arduino IDE.
  
## üéÆ Usage
* If you want to use the controller with NRF24 for a real Drone, you need to start the controller with AUX1 at HIGH Position
* If you want to use the controller with Bluetooth for a Drone Simulator, you need to start the controller with AUX1 at LOW Position
