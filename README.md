# üõ©Ô∏èRC Controller
This project is an ESP32-based RC controller that allows you to control RC drones via the NRF24 module and also use it for drone simulators on a PC through Bluetooth.

## Features:
- NRF24 Communication: Control real RC drones wirelessly using the NRF24L01 module.
- Bluetooth Connectivity: Seamlessly connect the controller to your computer for use with drone simulators, providing a realistic flying experience.
- Customizable: Modify and expand the code to suit your specific needs, whether for different types of drones or simulators.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works with various flight simulation software that supports Bluetooth controllers.
  
## Usage:
1. Flash the provided code onto the ESP32.
2. Connect your NRF24 module for RC drone control.
3. For simulators, pair the ESP32 via Bluetooth with your computer.
4. Adjust settings in the code for your drone model or simulator preferences.
